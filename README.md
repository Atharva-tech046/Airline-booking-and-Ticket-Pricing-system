## 📖 Overview

This project is a web-based **Airline Reservation System** designed to mimic real-world flight search platforms. Unlike static websites, this application includes a custom **"Data Seeding Engine"** that programmatically fills the database with realistic flight schedules, prices, and routes, allowing for robust testing and demonstration.

The application is fully deployed on **Render** using a CI/CD-like workflow where the database is automatically repopulated upon every deployment.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🔍 Real-Time Search:** Users can filter flights by Origin, Destination, and Travel Date.
* **📊 Dynamic Data Engine:** A custom script (`populate_flights.py`) generates 50+ random flights with realistic pricing algorithms every time the server starts.
* **🎨 Responsive UI:** Professional "Card View" interface with clean CSS styling and interactive elements.
* **☁️ Cloud Deployment:** Hosted on Render with production-grade settings (Gunicorn, WhiteNoise for static files).
* **⚡ Optimized Performance:** Uses SQLite for lightweight, fast queries in the deployment environment.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Django
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Fetch API)
* **Database:** SQLite (Production compatible with PostgreSQL)
* **Deployment:** Render Cloud, Gunicorn, WhiteNoise
